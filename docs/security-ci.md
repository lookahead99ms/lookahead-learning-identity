# Security CI

The existing `verify` job builds and tests this application, runs CodeQL security-extended analysis, checks fetched Git history for secrets, scans resolved dependencies and configuration, and scans both digest-pinned Temurin bases plus the built application image. It does not deploy anything. Python here is one-shot development tooling, not an application service.

## Local checks

From this repository with Java 21, Python 3 and Docker available:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/security -p 'test_*.py'
python3 tools/security/check.py install --tool trivy
python3 tools/security/check.py install --tool gitleaks
python3 tools/security/check.py history
python3 tools/security/check.py dependencies --build-system gradle
python3 tools/security/check.py sbom
python3 tools/security/check.py config
docker build --pull --tag lookahead-identity:security-ci-local .
python3 tools/security/check.py images --image lookahead-identity:security-ci-local
```

The installer verifies pinned archive checksums. Supported tool hosts are Linux AMD64 and macOS ARM64. Network access is required for dependency resolution, scanner databases and rule updates. History checks reject shallow repositories; fetch the complete intended history first. They inspect fetched refs, not inaccessible remote history.

## Gate and reporting policy

HIGH/CRITICAL dependency or configuration findings, unknown severity, any secret finding, scanner errors, or missing required package/configuration coverage fail the check. CodeQL security severity 7–10 fails; warning/error findings without severity also fail. Lower severity findings stay in local reports. Existing application test failures remain blocking. No automatic suppression or auto-merge is configured. Scanner environment overrides, repository ignore files and inline Gitleaks allow markers cannot disable these scans. A reviewed CodeQL false positive may use only the repository's explicit SAST exception contract: exact rule and repository-relative file, an unexpired review date, an owning ticket and rationale, and the SHA-256 digest of the reviewed source. Source drift, expiry, duplicate records, unmatched findings, and stale unused records all fail closed. A synthetic fixture already present in immutable fetched history may be recorded only by exact rule, file, line and commit with rationale; every other finding still fails, and a stale historical record also fails.

Reports and SBOMs are written under ignored `.codex-scratch/security/`. Raw source/secret reports are not uploaded by this workflow; CodeQL database and SARIF uploads are disabled. Secret matches are redacted in history output and omitted from summary logs. GitHub job logs and ordinary build output still follow repository visibility. Do not put actual credentials into test fixtures.

CodeQL execution occurs inside GitHub Actions around a clean build, using the CLI/query bundle linked to the pinned action. Local SARIF parser fixtures verify the gate, not analyzer completeness. CodeQL licensing permits this public repository; review licensing before applying this setup to a private repository. Rules inventory is not proof that every source file was analyzed.

## Coverage boundaries

Gradle resolution includes project/buildscript resolvable configurations. Maven scans the resolved project dependency tree across scopes; it does not claim complete Maven plugin dependency coverage. Container scans separately check OS packages and Java package inventory in the final application image. A clean report only concerns supported packages and the scanner database at scan time. It does not prove business authorization, payment safety or live AWS security. Application tests supplement SAST; real cross-service/account isolation probes need their documented private integration environment.

Dependabot proposes weekly Friday 11 AM America/New_York updates for the native build system, Docker bases and Actions. A base update requires review, rebuild, tests and rescanning; existing deployed containers do not update automatically. Enabling remote checks requires the user-owned Git cycle. Keep required status checks mapped to the actual `verify` job; do not add invented status names. Hosted execution, branch protection and failure-email delivery need their own verification.

## Temporary Tomcat override (DLV-916)

On 2026-09-19 Maven Central lists Boot 4.1.1 as the latest stable 4.1 release; its BOM manages Tomcat 11.0.24. This application retains Boot 4.1.1 and overrides embedded Tomcat to 11.0.25, the Apache-published fixed release. Gradle uses a group-scoped resolution rule; Maven uses the Boot parent `tomcat.version` property. Remove the override when a compatible stable Boot patch manages 11.0.25 or newer, then repeat dependency, security, contract and image checks. Do not switch to a milestone release solely to remove this override.
